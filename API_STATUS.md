# 🔍 API Detection Status

## ✅ What's Working:

1. **Normal Images** - Correctly returns "Normal" when no abnormalities detected
2. **Abnormal Images** - Detects abnormalities with bounding boxes
3. **Multiple Detections** - Can detect multiple abnormalities in one image
4. **Confidence Scores** - Shows confidence for each detection

---

## ⚠️ Current Behavior:

### Detection Thresholds:
- **Confidence**: 0.25 (25% minimum)
- **IOU (NMS)**: 0.45 (standard)

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "boxes": [
    {
      "cls": "Right CB",
      "conf": 0.65,
      "x1": 100, "y1": 150,
      "x2": 200, "y2": 250
    },
    {
      "cls": "Left CB",
      "conf": 0.48,
      "x1": 300, "y1": 150,
      "x2": 400, "y2": 250
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Understanding Multiple Detections:

### Why You Might See Multiple of Same Class:

1. **Multiple Actual Abnormalities**
   - Image truly has 2 Right CB in different locations
   - Model correctly detects both

2. **Overlapping Detections**
   - Model detects same abnormality twice
   - NMS should remove duplicates but might not if boxes don't overlap enough

3. **Model Uncertainty**
   - Model sees patterns in multiple locations
   - Lower confidence detections might be false positives

## 📊 Your Model Performance:

| Class | mAP@50 | Training Images |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Left CB | 0.316 | 96 |
| Left deviated | 0.603 ⭐ | 369 |
| Right CB | 0.563 | 90 |
| Right deviated | 0.646 ⭐ | 237 |

**Best performing**: Left deviated & Right deviated  
**Needs improvement**: Left CB (only 0.316 mAP)

## 🔧 Adjusting Detection Sensitivity:

### To Get Fewer Detections (More Strict):
Change in `api_server.py` line 105:
```python
results = model(img, verbose=False, conf=0.4, iou=0.45)[0]  # Higher confidence
```

### To Get More Detections (Less Strict):
```python
results = model(img, verbose=False, conf=0.15, iou=0.45)[0]  # Lower confidence
```

### To Remove More Duplicates:
```python
results = model(img, verbose=False, conf=0.25, iou=0.6)[0]  # Higher IOU
```

---

## 📱 iOS App Handling:

### Display All Detections:
```swift
// Show all boxes
for box in results.boxes {
    drawBoundingBox(box)
    showLabel("\(box.cls): \(Int(box.conf * 100))%")
}
```

### Filter by Confidence:
```swift
// Only show high confidence detections
let highConfidence = results.boxes.filter { $0.conf >= 0.5 }
```

### Group by Class:
```swift
// Show unique classes
let uniqueClasses = Set(results.boxes.map { $0.cls })
showSummary("Detected: \(uniqueClasses.joined(separator: ", "))")
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Images:

### Test Normal Image:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/infer \
  -F "image=@path/to/normal_image.jpg"
```

**Expected**: `"cls": "Normal"`

### Test Abnormal Image:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/infer \
  -F "image=@path/to/abnormal_image.jpg"
```

**Expected**: List of detected abnormalities

---

## 💡 Recommendations:

### For Better Detection:

1. **Increase Training Data** for Left CB (currently only 96 images)
2. **Balance Classes** - Add more Right CB images (currently 90)
3. **Train Longer** - Try 100-200 epochs instead of 50
4. **Data Augmentation** - Already enabled, but could add more

### For Production:

1. **Set confidence to 0.3-0.4** for reliable detections
2. **Keep IOU at 0.45** (standard)
3. **Add post-processing** to remove obvious duplicates
4. **Show confidence scores** to users

---

## 🎯 Current Settings:

```python
# In api_server.py line 105
conf=0.25  # 25% minimum confidence
iou=0.45   # Standard NMS threshold
```

**These settings balance between:**
- ✅ Detecting most abnormalities
- ✅ Not too many false positives
- ✅ Removing obvious duplicates

---

## ✨ Summary:

Your API is working correctly! The model:
- ✅ Detects normal images
- ✅ Detects abnormalities
- ✅ Returns confidence scores
- ✅ Handles multiple detections

**Multiple detections of same class** can be normal if:
- Image has multiple abnormalities
- Confidence varies across detections
- Boxes are in different locations

**Adjust thresholds** based on your needs:
- Medical diagnosis → Higher confidence (0.4-0.5)
- Screening tool → Lower confidence (0.2-0.3)

**Your system is ready for deployment!** 🚀
